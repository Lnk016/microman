# man

Something I created for personal use, decided I could upload it here.

Adds a `man` command which displays manual pages in a new, read-only tab without leaving Micro.

- Opens the man page in a new tab
- Buffer is read-only

## Requirements

- Micro >= 2.0.0
- Unix system with `man`, `sh`, and `col`
